    The position and orientation of the camera in relation to the subject(s) in a movie scene, namely level and camera angle, are essential features in the film-making process due to their influence on the viewer's perception of the scene.
Here, we propose to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the task of automatic recognition in movie frames of the camera angle (amongst five classes: Overhead, High, Neutral, Low, and Dutch) and camera level (amongst Aerial, Eye, Shoulder, Hip, Knee, and Ground).
The developed models, the annotation tool, and frame data are made available  for a wide range of research purposes, such as movie stylistic analysis, video recommendation, and media psychology.

<!-- #region -->
<p>For the aim of this work, we annotate camera angle on five different classes: Overhead, High, Neutral, Low, Dutch, as shown
in Figure 1 (first row). The angle class describes camera rotation along both lateral (High, Neutral, and Low) and longitudinal (Dutch) axes. 
In particular, an Overhead-angle indicates a take looking down on a subject from an almost perpendicular direction.
On the other hand, we categorize camera level (i.e., the height of the camera in the scene in relation to the subject being framed) into
six different classes: Aerial, Eye, Shoulder, Hip, Knee, Ground, as shown in Figure 1 (second row). The particular class of Aerial-level
is used for shots taken from a considerable height, such as from a plane or a drone, showing a large portion of the surroundings. All
annotations were performed by a team of expert film scholars: two independent coders and a third person who made decisions in cases
of disagreement.</p>

<p>The dataset used for the task of automatic classification of camera angles and levels in movie frames has been collected from various
sources:</p>

<p>• All frames in classes Eye-, Shoulder-, and Hip-level were automatically sampled from films by various authors (e.g., Scorsese,
Bergman, etc.) of the main CineScale dataset.</p>

<p>• Classes that rarely appear in movies, such as Ground- or Knee- level shots were retrieved through Google’s image search, then
automatically downloaded, and finally manually filtered;</p>

<p>• Most Aerial-level images were extracted (at 10 second intervals) from videos taken by drones over various cities and landscapes
from freely available clips on the web;</p>

<p>• Images from other classes were scraped from shot examples taken from <a href="https://shots.filmschoolrejects.com/">Film School Rejects’ online database</a></p>
