# What is the aim?

Our project aims to delve into the world of movies and leverage the power of artificial intelligence to recognize and analyze various cinematic features. Through extensive research and development, we have curated many extensive database consisting of over one million frames from more than 100 movies, all extracted in JPEG format at a rate of one frame per second.

The heart of our project lies in the extraction of cinematic features using cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques. We have developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model specifically designed for the recognition of these features.
Our AI-driven features extraction models serve as a powerful tool for filmmakers, researchers, and cinema enthusiasts alike. It enables a deeper understanding of the visual language employed in movies, allowing for precise analysis and comparison of different films. With CineScale, you can explore the technical aspects of movies, uncover hidden patterns, and gain valuable insights into the art of filmmaking.
